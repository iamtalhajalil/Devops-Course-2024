## Blog 1: Using Knative with Docker: From Containers to Serverless

The first blog, **"Using Knative with Docker: From Containers to Serverless,"** highlights the evolution from containerized workloads to serverless architectures using Knative, an open-source extension of Kubernetes. Knative simplifies deploying, scaling, and managing serverless applications by integrating with Docker. It enables developers to focus on code while automating infrastructure management tasks such as scaling and load balancing. The blog provides a step-by-step guide to deploying a simple Flask application containerized with Docker and deploying it using Knative Serving. Key benefits include dynamic scaling that adjusts based on demand, reducing operational overhead and costs while maintaining responsiveness.

## Blog 2: Docker Networking: How Containers Communicate

The second blog, **"Docker Networking: How Containers Communicate,"** delves into how Docker enables communication between containers and external systems through various networking drivers. It explains the features and use cases of Dockerâ€™s network types, including the default bridge network, high-performance host network, multi-host overlay network, and isolated none network. The blog outlines communication methods within and across networks and emphasizes best practices, such as using bridge networks for local development and overlay networks for multi-host communication. Understanding these networking mechanisms allows developers to design scalable, secure, and efficient containerized application architectures.
