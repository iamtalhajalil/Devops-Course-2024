# What I Have Learned in DevOps Course

## Introduction to DevOps
- **DevOps Overview**: Understanding the principles of DevOps, focusing on collaboration between development and operations teams to enhance software delivery.
- **Benefits of DevOps**: Faster deployment, improved collaboration, and higher quality software through automation and streamlined workflows.

## CI/CD Pipelines
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single project.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: Ensuring that code is automatically tested and prepared for deployment to production environments.
- Tools: Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI.

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Concept**: Managing and provisioning infrastructure using machine-readable configuration files.
- **Tools and Technologies**: Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Ansible.
- Benefits: Consistency, scalability, and repeatability in managing infrastructure.

## Monitoring and Logging
- **Monitoring Tools**: Learning to track application and system performance using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Nagios.
- **Logging**: Collecting and analyzing logs for debugging and optimizing application performance (e.g., ELK Stack - Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).

## Containerization and Orchestration
- **Containerization**: Packaging applications and dependencies into portable containers using Docker.
- **Orchestration**: Managing and scaling containers with Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and OpenShift.
- Benefits: Portability, scalability, and efficient resource utilization.

## Key DevOps Tools
- **Jenkins**: Automating CI/CD pipelines.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform.
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration tool for managing clusters.
- **Git**: Version control system for managing source code.

## Additional Concepts
- **Agile Methodologies**: Integration of Agile principles with DevOps for iterative and incremental software development.
- **Cloud Platforms**: Working with cloud environments such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud to deploy and scale applications.
- **Security in DevOps**: Learning DevSecOps to integrate security practices in the DevOps workflow.
